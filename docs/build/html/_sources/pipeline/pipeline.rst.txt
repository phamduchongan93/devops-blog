Setting up pipeline
-------------------

Generally, containerizing the pipeline is good for portability. Because most of the time II need my apps to work on variety of enviroment, I would put the code in a container.  However, there are scenarios where I found the need to run on a dedicated host or VM. This is because I can perform full integration testing. This would help to see how the new code affect my system.
